# Welcome to my Hangman-Game

## Play some Hangman from within in your terminal!

Hangman is a fun and interactive game where the user plays a word-guessing game by guessing the letters of a random word generated by the computer. The user will have up to 6 chances for guessing a wrong letter, until the visual on the screen will depict a 'hanged man' indicating you have lost the game. Complete the word in full before your 7 chances are up and you have won the game.
